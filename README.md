# JFET-Applications-Constant-Current-Source-Chopper
JFET Applications | Constant Current Source | Chopper in Proteus.
There are two files in this repository that are based upon the application of Junction Field Effect Transistor as Chopper and as the constant current source.These are very mnageable circuits with very little components. You can check other painless yet important circuits at www.theengineeringprojects.com .
